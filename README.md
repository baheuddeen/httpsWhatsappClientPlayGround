# Welcome to Whatsapp Play Ground!

The reason why i created this repo is because multiple people asked for a way to send Advs messages to a hug list of clients for marketing purposes.
This is a simple way to connect to Whatsapp and start sending messages with the amazing power of node.js
you can have fun with this tool rather than sending boring messages to poor people.
for example, when any one send you a message start with "love n" it will send back "I love you" n times, of course n is a number.
you also can create a connection with chatgpt API and forward the messages you receive as a prompt and reply with chatgpt answer. this might help when your lover asks you to tell me a joke, or a story and you don't have time :D. 

# Spec
My node version is v18.16.1
I believe other node versions will also work! 

## Create files and folders

Data.csv will have the data for people you want to send messages

## Install
```
npm install
```

## build

```
npm run build
```

## run

```
npm run start
```

## QR code will show in the console

Scan this QR code in your mobile whatsapp.
the login information will be cached locally in data.json directory.
don't share it with anyone.
caching is to prevent scanning QR code every time you start.
you can remove the sessions easily from your whatapp mobile app or delete the folder.
