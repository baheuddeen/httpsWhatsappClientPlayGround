# Welcome to Whatsapp Play Ground!

I created this repository in response to multiple requests for a method to send advertising messages to a large list of clients for marketing purposes. It provides a straightforward way to connect to WhatsApp and begin sending messages using the powerful capabilities of Node.js. With this tool, you can inject some fun into your messaging instead of simply sending dull messages to recipients.

For instance, if someone sends you a message starting with "love n" the tool will respond with "I love you" repeated n times, where n is a number specified. Additionally, you can establish a connection with the ChatGPT API to forward received messages as prompts and reply with ChatGPT-generated responses. This feature could be particularly useful when your fiancÃ© requests a joke or story, and you have time to answer. ðŸ˜„

# Spec
My node version is v18.16.1
I believe other node versions will also work!

## Install
```
npm install
```

## build

```
npm run build
```

## run

```
npm run start
```

## QR code will show in the console

Scan this QR code in your mobile whatsapp.
the login information will be cached locally in data.json directory.
don't share it with anyone.
caching is to prevent scanning QR code every time you start.
you can remove the sessions easily from your whatapp mobile app or delete the folder.
